The Psalter 1912 Data Repository
===
Welcome! Here is where you'll find the data that is used in the Psalter 1912 project(s).

### You'll probably want to include this repository as a git submodule rather than copying from it directly.

    git submodule add https://github.com/iThinkyouknow/psalter1912-data.git

From your main project if you ever need to clone it from start,

    git clone --recurse-submodules <your project url>

When you are pulling in your main project and would also like to pull whatever is the latest from the submodule

    git pull --recurse-submodules
